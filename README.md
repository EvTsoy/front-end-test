- About the challenge:
  It was really a good experience for me. I want to thank LittleData for opportunity to show my skills on that project.

- Future improvements on code
  On next release I would ofcourse implement backend And login/logout logic
  On front I would write more tests. Implementing maybe end to end tests using some library
  I think ther is endless possibilities to create and go further
  Thats why I love my profession
